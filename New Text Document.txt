Cricket is an eleven player sport played on a 22 yard pitch. The match involves two innings. A toss is held according to which the team which has won the toss decides whether they bat or field in the first innings. While batting the main motive is to score as many runs as possible without being out. On the other hand, while fielding the goal is to get all the batsmen out and not let them score much.
